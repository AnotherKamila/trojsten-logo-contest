A terribly simple web for the Trojsten New Logo Contest, which will occur some time around July 2013.

It is planned to run on the Heroku platform, using *TODO what is that service's name?* to outsource all image storage, manipulation and fast distribution. Therefore, I don't need to deal with anything and the website should be up and running very fast, while being a lot more reliable than if using any non-managed infrastructure.
